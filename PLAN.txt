  Plan for the Breakout game

In this game I will try to create a multi-player version of the Breakout game,
for example, there can be two players who need to cooperate with each other to play the game. There 
are two paddles in this game and these two players can operate on any of the paddle. But I want to add 
a constraint that if the two paddles collide with each other then there should be some punishment to 
the result of the game. Thus the two players should make sure that they do not collide and the ball do 
not hit the bottom at the same time.

I want to create three levels for this game. And the first level is easy, the second level is harder than
 the first one and the third level is the hardest. I will try to decrease the size of the paddles as the 
 level increases. I also want to change the speed of the ball so that as the level increases  the speed of 
 the ball is faster.
 
 I want to create three different blocks. Some blocks are cleared after 1 hit. Some other blocks need 2 hits
 to be cleared out. And there will be blocks which give power-ups.
 
 I will make the ball bounce differently depending on where it hits. The paddle can hold the ball and release
  it at a later time. The two paddles can become one paddle if the two players want one longer paddle.
 
 I will make three different kinds of power-ups. Some blocks drop power-ups when they are destroyed which,
  when caught by the player's paddle, affect the game in various ways: making the paddle longer, speeding up 
  the ball, decreasing the speed of the ball.
  
  I will make one cheat key.  When one of the two players inputs a numeric key (i.e., 1-3), clear the 
  current level and jump to the level corresponding to the number. 
  
  I want to add some background images or songs to make the game more interesting.
